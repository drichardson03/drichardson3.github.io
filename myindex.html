                <h1>My name is DaeJane (pronounced Day-Juh-Nay)</h1>
                <p>I graduated from NC State with both a Bachelor in Environmental Architecture and Architecture. I also have 
                a minor in Landscape Architecture and love when a design works seamlessly with the surrounding area. I'm currently
                working on getting a degree in Architectural Technology and Information technology to help growing my skillsets for the future.</p>
