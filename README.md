# Who am I?
### My name is DaeJane (pronounced Day-Juh-Nay) and I have a Bachelor of Architecture Degree from NC State University. I am 28 years old and and a January Capricorn. I'm currently enrolled in Wake Tech for Architectural Technology and Computer Programming and Development to further build my BIM skills within my field. I look forward to learning a lot from my Web, PGM, & Db Foundation class!

## Things I love to do!
#### I absolutely _love_ collecting records when I have the time for it. My record/vinyl collection is currently at 174!
#### I've also recently picked up getting Funko pops but I'm more so interested in getting characters I really like not necessarily full collections.
#### I've also picked up working on a lot of my smaller car issues instead of immediately taking it to a mechanic. I've added a carplay/touchscreen system, replaced my yellowed halogen lights to LEDs, and I want to add light kits to my door so a cool image will flash onto the ground when they're open. I've also thought about adding a backup camera to my car but I'm really good at backing into parking spaces so it's not really a need honestly.
#### Other things I want to spend more time learning and picking up are 3D printing, walking and going to trails, and traveling. I also wanto to learn how to drive manual transmission cars. They're normally a few thousand dollars cheaper than automatics and I'd think it be a cool skill to have under my belt.

## Websites I enjoy
#### I use a website/app called Discogs to keep track of my records and CDs. Here is a link to my record [collection!](https://discogs.page.link/izAc)
#### If you've ever wanted to turn yourself into a collectible item, Funko Pop has a cool option called [**Pop! Yourself**](https://funko.com/pop-yourself.html)
