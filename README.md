# My name is DaeJane (pronounced Day-Juh-Nay) and I have a Bachelor of Architecture Degree from NC State University. I am 28 years old and I'm currently enrolled in Wake Tech for Architectural Technology and Computer Programming and Development to further build my BIM skills within my field. I look forward to learning a lot from my Web, PGM, & Db Foundation class!
